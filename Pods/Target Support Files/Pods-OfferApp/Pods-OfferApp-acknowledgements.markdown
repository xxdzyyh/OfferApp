					  1.0 Introduction.
					  These Terms of Service constitute the agreement between You and Dynatrace, a division of Dynatrace LLC, a Delaware company (together hereinafter referred to as 'Dynatrace'). BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE REVIEWED AND ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND ARE AUTHORIZED TO ACT ON BEHALF OF, AND BIND YOUR ENTITY ('CLIENT') TO THIS AGREEMENT.
					  Dynatrace reserves the right to change or modify these Terms of Service at our sole discretion at any time by posting updated Terms of Service on the Dynatrace website. Any change or modification to the Terms of Service will be effective immediately upon posting. In all cases, your continued use of the Services after publication of such modifications constitutes binding acceptance of the modified Terms of Service.

					  2.0 Scope of the Dynatrace Service; Restrictions.
					  The 'Service' shall be defined as the hosted services, electronic reports, analyses, documentation or Auxiliary Programs provided by Dynatrace under this Agreement which are necessary to deploy the service. Client shall have the right to use the Service ordered and made available to Client by Dynatrace hereunder for their internal use. 'Auxiliary Program'. means any software, agent or equipment that Dynatrace makes available to Client as part of the Service for purposes of facilitating access to, operation of, and/or use with, the Service.
					  Client shall not: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, decode, decrypt, disassemble, or in any way derive source code from the Service and/or Auxiliary Programs; (b) modify, translate, adapt, alter, or create derivative works from the Service and/or Auxiliary Programs; (c) copy, distribute, publicly display, transmit, make available in any 'public' area or accessible on the World Wide Web; (d) sublicense, sell, rent, or lease the Service and/or Auxiliary Programs; or (e) use the Service and/or Auxiliary Programs for the purposes of competing with Dynatrace, including without limitation competitive intelligence or analysis.

					  3.0 Pricing & Payment Terms.
					  Prices for the Service are set forth on the Dynatrace website. Payment may be made either immediately by credit card, or invoiced as provided herein. If payment is made by invoice, Dynatrace will invoice the full invoice and Client shall remit payment within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Overdue invoices shall bear interest at 1.5% per month or such lower rate as shall be the then highest rate permitted by law. Client shall pay all applicable taxes due under this Agreement, except taxes based on Dynatrace's net income unless Client provides Dynatrace with a properly completed exemption certificate. All prices are exclusive of all taxes, duties, VAT, withholdings and other governmental assessments. Dynatrace reserves the right to suspend Services and delete all Client date held by Dynatrace, if Client fails to pay as provided herein.

					  4.0 Intellectual Property.
					  Client acknowledges and agrees that all ownership and proprietary rights to the Service, Auxiliary Programs and the contents thereof and all related intellectual property are and shall remain the property exclusively of Dynatrace. Dynatrace retains full rights of ownership and use in: (a) any programs, products, materials or methodologies or materials of Dynatrace created and/or developed by Dynatrace prior to or independently of the Services contemplated herein ('Pre-existing Works'); and (b) all materials, methodologies, processes, techniques, ideas, concepts, trade secrets, and know-how, which may be created or developed in connection with the Services and are modifications and/or derivatives of Dynatrace's Pre-existing Works.

					  5.0 Confidentiality.
					  Each party agrees: (a) that it will not disclose to any third party or use any confidential or proprietary information disclosed to it by the other party (collectively, 'Confidential Information') except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; and (b) that it will take all commercially reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information of the other party in its possession or control, which will in no event be less than the measures it uses to maintain the confidentiality of its own information of similar importance. Confidential Information will not include information that: (i) is in or enters the public domain without breach of this Agreement; (ii) the receiving party lawfully receives from a third party without restriction on disclosure and without breach of a nondisclosure obligation; or (iii) the receiving party develops independently.

					  Client agrees that the Service: i) is Confidential Information; and ii) constitutes valuable assets and confidential trade secrets of Dynatrace. Client therefore agrees to keep in confidence and protect the Service, including but not limited to screenshots, ideas, concepts, designs, specifications, computer programs and strategies from disclosure to third parties and restrict its use as provided in this Agreement

					  6.0 Term and Termination.
					  The term ('Term') of the Service shall be specified as specified on the Dynatrace website.

					  7.0 Warranty.
					  Dynatrace warrants that the Service will function in substantial compliance with their specifications published by Dynatrace (available at help.dynatrace.com). Client acknowledges that changes by Client to its monitoring profile or corrupted, incomplete and/or interrupted data received by Dynatrace from Client's site(s), may have a material impact on the accuracy, reliability and/or timeliness of Service results, and Dynatrace shall not be responsible for any such factors beyond its reasonable control. THE ABOVE WARRANTIES ARE DYNATRACE'S ONLY WARRANTIES AND NO OTHER WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WILL APPLY.

					  Client represents and warrants that Client shall; (i) abide by all laws, rules and regulations; and (ii) be responsible for all content or materials originating from its Web site(s) (its 'Content').

					  8.0 Limitation of Liability.
					  THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF DYNATRACE AND CLIENT'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR DAMAGES FROM ANY CAUSE RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED ANY FEES PAID, IF ANY, BY CLIENT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM OVER THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD.

					  9.0 Limitation of Damages.
					  IN NO EVENT WILL DYNATRACE BE LIABLE FOR: (I) INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; OR (II) LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO CLIENT'S DATA FROM ANY CAUSE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF USE, REVENUES, PROFITS, SAVINGS, EVEN IF DYNATRACE KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

					  10.0 Indemnification.
					  Each party (the 'Indemnifying Party') shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and such other party's officers, directors, employees and agents (each, an 'Indemnified Party') from and against any and all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by an Indemnifying Party's breach (i) of any obligation set forth in sections 2.0 (Scope of the Service; Restrictions) or 5.0 (Confidentiality).

During the Early Access Program Dynatrace will be in the stage of 'Early Adoption' and is provisioned for test purposes only. The Client acknowledges that the Service and Auxiliary Programs are in a stage of 'Early Adoption'. Therefore, Auxiliary Programs shall only be installed on computers which are regularly used by the Client for test purposes and are the property of or are permanently owned by the Client ('Designated Computers'). The use of Auxiliary Programs in a productive environment without any additional testing or adaptation to the specific requirements of an individual system environment may cause severe system failure.

					  The Early Adoption Program Services are provided AS IS, with no warranties, express or implied. Client agrees that due to the nature of the Early Adoption Program, Client may receive non-public technology, know-how and trade secrets, including, without limitation, ideas, concepts, designs, specifications, computer programs and strategies.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
